## Linear Regression
### Concept of Linear Regression
<p>
    In regression, we want to predict continuous values whereas in classifications we want to predict a discrete value like a class label 0 or      1. So if we have a look at this example plot then we want to approximate this data with a linear function that's why it's called linear regression so we use a linear function to predict the values so we can define the approximation as
